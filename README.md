# 🚦 Rad Sign Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a **Rad Sign Detection System** developed using **PyTorch** and trained in **Google Colab**. The system detects and classifies different types of road signs using a custom dataset obtained from **Roboflow**. It can assist in intelligent traffic systems and research in autonomous vehicles.

## 📌 Overview

- **Model**: Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Dataset**: Roboflow - road sign detection dataset
- **Environment**: Google Colab
- **Accuracy**: Achieved high accuracy on validation set

## 📁 Project Structure

- `rad_sign_detection.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook with full pipeline (preprocessing, training, testing)
- `model.pth` – Trained model weights
- `dataset/` – Road sign images (train/test) from roboflow
